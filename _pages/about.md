Hi, I am Frank Ran (冉俊豪), a master student of [Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rice University](https://eceweb.rice.edu/). My research interest is Long Context Language Model, Topic Segmentation and Rumor Detection. 

Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering from [The Chinese Univeristy of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en).

I lived in the mountain city Chongqing for 18 years, in Shenzhen for 4 years, and now live in Houston.
