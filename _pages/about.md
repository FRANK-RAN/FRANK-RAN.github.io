Hi, I am Frank Ran (冉俊豪), a Master’s student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rice University](https://eceweb.rice.edu/). I previously earned my bachelor’s degree in computer science and engineering from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en).



I lived in the mountain city of Chongqing for 18 years, in Shenzhen for 4 years, and now reside in Houston.
